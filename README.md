This project is a Vigen√®re cipher encryption system made in Python. 

It includes three files: driver.py (main program and user interface), logging.py (logs actions with timestamps), and encryption.py (handles encryption and decryption logic).

To run the program, use the command python driver.py logging.file, replacing logging.file with the name of your log file (e.g., output.txt).

Passwords are stored in memory only for security and are never logged. 
Encryption and decryption results are saved to the log and can be reused during the session. 
The program includes input validation, history menus, and prevents encrypting or decrypting before setting a password.

I had forgotten to create the repository before starting the project and had done my notes and code in local computer,
last minute had to put everything together.
